# RETANX
React strategy POC with A*, divs and CSS transitions.

**DISCLAIMER** <br />
*This non-canvas route is stupid at best... still, itÂ´s fun to see how far we can go!*

#### Run it
Do a **yarn add** or **npm install**, then **yarn run watch-css** in one tab for scss changes and **yarn start** in another to start RETANX

#### PRs are welcomed, to contribute make sure that:
* Branch name references issue number if it adresses a feature / bug fix.
* Branch has already been [synced with the upstream repo](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) and any merge-conflicts have been resolved.
